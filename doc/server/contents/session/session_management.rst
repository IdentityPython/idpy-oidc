About session management
------------------------
.. _`About session management`:

The OIDC Session Management draft defines session to be:

    Continuous period of time during which an End-User accesses a Relying
    Party relying on the Authentication of the End-User performed by the
    OpenID Provider.

Note that we are dealing with a Single Sign On (SSO) context here.
If for some reason the OP does not want to support SSO then the
session management has to be done a bit differently. In that case each
session (user_id,client_id) would have its own authentication event. Not one
shared between the sessions.

Design criteria
+++++++++++++++
.. _`Design criteria`:

So a session is defined by a user and a Relying Party. If one adds to that
that a user can have several sessions active at the same time each one against
a unique Relying Party we have the bases for session management.

Furthermore the user may well decide on different rules for different
relying parties for releasing user
attributes, where and how issued access tokens could be used and whether
refresh tokens should be issued or not.

We also need to keep track on which tokens where used to mint new tokens
such that we can easily revoked a suite of tokens all with a common ancestor.

Database layout
+++++++++++++++
.. _`Database layout`:

The database is organized in 3 levels. The top one being the users.
Below that the Relying Parties and at the bottom what is called grants.

Grants organize authorization codes, access tokens and refresh tokens (and
possibly other types of tokens) in a comprehensive way. More about that below.

There may be many Relying Parties below a user and many grants below a
Relying Party.

The information structure
-------------------------
.. _SM-info-structure:

As stated above there are 3 layers: user session information, client session
information and grants. But first the keys to the information.

Session key
+++++++++++
.. _`Session key`:

A key to the session information is based on a list. The first item being the
user identifier, the second the client identifier and the third the grant
identifier.
If you only want the user session information then the key is a list with one
item the user id. If you want the client session information the key is a
list with 2 items (user_id, client_id). And lastly if you want a grant then
the key is a list with 3 elements (user_id, client_id, grant_id).

Example::
    "diana;;KtEST70jZx1x;;85544c9cace411ebab53559c5425fcc0"

A *session identifier* is constructed using the **session_key** function.
It takes as input the 3 elements list.::

    session_id = session_key(user_id, client_id, grant_id)


Using the function **unpack_session_key** you can get the elements from a
session_id.::

    user_id, client_id, grant_id = unpack_session_id(session_id)


User session information
++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. _`User session information`:

Houses the authentication event information which is the same for all session
connected to a user.
Here we also have a list of all the clients that this user has a session with.
Expressed as a dictionary this can look like this::

    {
        'authentication_event': {
            'uid': 'diana',
            'authn_info': "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:InternetProtocolPassword",
            'authn_time': 1605515787,
            'valid_until': 1605519387
        },
        'subordinate': ['client_1']
    }


Client session information
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. _`Client session information`:

The client specific information of the session information.
Presently only the authorization request and the subject identifier (sub).
The subordinates to this set of information are the grants::

    {
        'authorization_request':{
            'client_id': 'client_1',
            'redirect_uri': 'https://example.com/cb',
            'scope': ['openid', 'research_and_scholarship'],
            'state': 'STATE',
            'response_type': ['code']
        },
        'sub': '117afe8d7bb0ace8e7fb2706034ab2d3fbf17f0fd4c949aa9c23aedd051cc9e3',
        'subordinate': ['e996c61227e711eba173acde48001122'],
        'revoked': False
    }

Grant information
+++++++++++++++++
.. _`Grant information`:

Grants are created by an authorization subsystem in an OP. If the grant is
created in connection with an user authentication the authorization system
might normally ask the user for usage consent and then base the construction
of the grant on that consent.

If an authorization server can act as a Security Token Service (STS) as
defined by `Token Exchange [RFC-8693] <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8693>`_
then no user is involved. In the context of session management the STS is
equivalent to a user.

Grant information contains information about user consent and issued tokens.::

is used. With one addition, beside *userinfo* and *id_token* we have added
*introspection*.

of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

not_before
::::::::::
If the usage of the grant should be delay, this is when it can start being used.
Its value is a JSON number representing the number
of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

- access_token and
- refresh_token

id
::
The grant identifier.

Token
+++++
.. _`Token`:

As mention above there are presently only 3 token types that are defined:

- authorization_code,
- access_token and
- refresh_token

A token is described as follows::

            },
        "used": 0,
        "based_on": null,
        "id": "96d19bea275211eba43bacde48001122"
    }


type
::::
The type of token.

issued_at
:::::::::
When the token was created. Its value is a JSON number representing the number
of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

not_before
::::::::::
If the start of the usage of the token is to be delay, this is until when.
Its value is a JSON number representing the number
of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

expires_at
::::::::::
When the token expires.
Its value is a JSON number representing the number
of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

revoked
:::::::
If the token has been revoked.

value
:::::
This is the value that appears in OIDC protocol exchanges.

usage_rules
:::::::::::
Rules as to how this token can be used:

expires_in
    Used to calculate expires_at

supports_minting
    The tokens types that can be minted based on this token. Typically a code
    can be used to mint ID tokens and access and refresh tokens.

max_usage
    How many times this token can be used (being used is presently defined as
    used to mint other tokens). An authorization_code token can according to
    the OIDC standard only be used once but then to, in the same session,
    mint more then one token.

used
::::
    How many times the token has been used

based_on
::::::::
    Reference to the token that was used to mint this token. Might be empty if the
    token was minted based on the grant it belongs to.

id
::
    Token identifier

create_session
++++++++++++++
.. _create_session:

Creating a new session is done by running the create_session method of
the class SessionManager. The create_session methods takes the following
arguments.

authn_event
    An AuthnEvent class instance that describes the authentication event.

auth_req
    The Authentication request

client_id
    The client Identifier

user_id
    The user identifier

    A possible sector identifier to be used when constructing a pairwise
    subject identifier

sub_type
    The type of subject identifier that should be constructed. It can either be
    *pairwise* or *public*.

So a typical command would look like this::


    authn_event = create_authn_event(self.user_id)
    session_manager.create_session(authn_event=authn_event, auth_req=auth_req,
                                   user_id=self.user_id, client_id=client_id,
